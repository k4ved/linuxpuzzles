## Summary

I’m a Security Architect by trade. I have experience in everything from Linux & Windows Management, code development, infrastructure automation, business management, security compliance, and more. I’m well-versed in numerous programming languages including PHP, SQL, Python, Golang and Javascript. For fun I travel, ride motorcycles, and play tennis. I also spend time helping others with financial decisions.

My FCC Callsign is K4VED if you are ever on the radio and hear me, give me a shout!
